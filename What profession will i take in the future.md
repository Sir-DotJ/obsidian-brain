Seeing as I am taking a degree in software engineering, it is fair to say that I see myself pursuing a career in programming in the future.
As to what specific kind of job is fit for me, I expect to either be a software engineer or IT consultant.

As a software engineer, I see myself designing and developing system level software (database systems, operating systems maybe even video games if such opportunity arises), which will most certainly involve talking to clients and other engineers to create the optimal solutions.
I make well optimized code, learn quick and can talk to people fairly well, so I think I would do well in that profession.

And as an IT consultant, I would be expected to provide technical expertise to develop the optimal IT systems for clients.
I have a good way of cataloging and finding information, so it should be no problem getting the right technical literature for making a well fit system.

I expect, since we are living in an information age and everything is more and more dependent on computers, that the jobs to develop system level software or IT systems will not be going away any time soon. So there will always be work, and currently it is well paid work.
I doubt programmers will go obsolete, since this kind of job requires mental work and creativity. Artificial Intelligence is incapable of that at the moment, so robots won't be coding other robots for a long time.
