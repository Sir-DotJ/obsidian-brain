# Introduction:
Greetings, my name is Sergey Lukashevich and today I'd like to report on recent results of our research about robots in our day-to-day lives.
We're going to discuss:
- Their use in manufacturing ([recent bus/car automated factories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Qyor9Yc-s));
- Status of self-driving cars technology (we're currently on “level 2 out of 5” on [development of self-driving cars](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/self-driving-cars-status-progress-technology-safety/));
- Current most advanced personal robot assistants (source: https://ideaing.com/ideas/the-best-robot-personal-assistants/):
	- I would divide them into several groups:
		- Kids toys (ex: "Wonder Workshop Dash- Coding Robot", "Ruko Smart Robot", "Sphero SPRK+"). They are mostly used to entertain children through numerous activities these robots can perform.
		- Surveillance robots (ex: flying "Ring Always Home Cam", "Amazon Astro Household Robot for Home Monitoring"). Self-explanatory.
		- "Worker" robots (ex: "WORX 20V LANDROID Cordless Robotic Mower", "Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus Robotic Pool Vacuum Cleaner", "Roborock S7+ Robot Vacuum and Sonic Mop with Auto-Empty Dock", "SKYMEE Owl Robot: Mobile Full HD Pet Camera with Treat Dispenser"). Mostly used to clean or take care of the house.
		- Smart devices (ex: "Alexa", "Amazon Echo", "Alisa", "Smart Displays" and other "smart" devices). They are equipped with voice recognition technology and connected to internet and or local network, which allows users to control them remotely either through voice or through their smartphones.
Feel free to ask questions at any point during the presentation.

Add to presentation:
 - Information about Toyota vehicle manufacture (compare their way of doing things);
 - Information about self-driving car companies utilizing the technology already;
 - Important dates and statistics should be written out on screen during presentation;
 - As notes leave only most important info and tit bits, everything else learn;
 - More info on personal robot assistants (such as where they are most popular right now, their affordability);
 - Talk about robots future endeavors.
